## Standing Wave Simulation (README.md)

This document describes a Python script simulating a standing wave in a one-dimensional medium and analyzing its behavior over time. The script focuses on the concept of energy localization and the "point of oblivion," where the wave amplitude becomes negligible.

**Key Functionalities:**

* **Data Generation (`generate_data`):**
    * Calculates spatial and temporal steps based on medium length, total time, and number of points (using `np.linspace`).
    * Defines initial conditions for the wave amplitude.
    * Calculates and stores the amplitude at each point in space and time, along with the total energy.
    * Prints key information about the simulation setup and total energy.
* **Data Visualization (`plot_data`):**
    * Creates a two-subplot figure for visualization using `plt.figure`.
    * Plots the amplitude of the wave at selected time steps.
    * Highlights the "point of oblivion" (x = L/2) where the amplitude approaches zero with a marker.
    * Plots the total energy over time.
* **Simulation Loop (`simulate`):**
    * Calls `generate_data` to create the initial wave data.
    * Calls `plot_data` to visualize the amplitude and energy.
    * Iterates through all points in space and time, searching for positions where the amplitude falls below a threshold (0.01).
    * If such a point is found, prints the corresponding time and position.
    * If there's remaining time after the amplitude drops, recursively calls `simulate` with the remaining time to continue the simulation for those points.

**Script Usage:**

1. **Run the script:** Execute the script using `python your_script_name.py`.
2. **Observe the output:** The script will print:
    * Information about the simulation setup (length, total time, frequency).
    * Total energy.
    * Time and position where the amplitude falls below the threshold (optional, printed recursively).
    * Visualization of the amplitude and energy over time.

**Experimentation:**

* Modify the script's parameters (L, T, Nx, Nt, omega, phase_shift) to explore their impact on the wave behavior and "point of oblivion."
* Adjust the plotting parameters (e.g., `ylim`) to customize the visualization.

**Dependencies:**

* This script requires the following Python libraries:
    * `numpy`
    * `matplotlib.pyplot`

**Additional Notes:**

* The script uses Planck length and time as constants for illustrative purposes, but these values can be replaced with more realistic parameters.
* The code includes comments to explain the logic behind each function.
